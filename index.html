    For now we only have salmon cookies, but very soon we will have cookies
    made from many different kinds of fish. We don't want to give anything away,
    but we're planning to make cookies from 2.5 of these different fishes!

    This is NOT one of the fish we butcher to make delicious fish cookies. She
    is a dear friend of the family. If you see her please do not devour her so you may sate your mighty hungry.
    Just bring her back to us and we'll provide you with bags of edible sea-creatures in cookie form!
